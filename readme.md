# Penfold - The Discord Bot

### Self hosting
Here's what you need to self host Penfold:

- A basic text editor to edit the [configuration](./src/data/config.example.json) file
- A valid Discord bot token (which you can acquire by accessing [this](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) page)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10 or newer

How to do it:

- Edit the `config.example.json` file in src/data/ and then rename it to `config.json`
- Install the required npm packages using `npm install`
- Run the bot using `node bot` (must be in src folder)

*Optionally, if you want to run the bot in a process manager, we recommend using **[pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)**!*
